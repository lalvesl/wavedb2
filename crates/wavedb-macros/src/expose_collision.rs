//! The generated registry **collision guard** — split from [`crate::expose`]
//! for the file budget.
//!
//! Both checks are pairwise over the declared entries and both resolve at
//! **compile time**, so a clash is caught by `cargo check`, never deferred to a
//! test run:
//!
//! - **Full 64-bit `STRUCT_HASH`** — a hard error. Two entries sharing it would
//!   have one arm silently shadow the other in every dispatch `match`, and the
//!   wire could not tell the types apart at all.
//! - **15-bit `type_salt`** (the low bits of the same hash) — a warning. Reads
//!   stay correct (the full head is verified), but the pair shares archive slots
//!   and loses its separation in the browser's flat keyspace, so it is surfaced
//!   rather than enforced.
//!
//! The salt check counts **every occupant**, not one per entry: since RFC 0050
//! a NonUnique type also reserves three chain lanes (`WDB.SEG`, `WDB.DEAD`,
//! `WDB.IDX`), each with a hash of its own and therefore a salt of its own. A
//! registry of `n` such types puts `4n` values in a 15-bit space — comparing
//! only the record hashes would leave three quarters of them unchecked, over
//! exactly the property the lanes exist to provide ("a segment id can never
//! equal a record anchor, an archive slot, or a tree node"). Hence also the
//! per-entry self-check: a type can clash with its own lane alone.
