//! Do the sparse index's element counts still agree with the segments they name
//! **after a crash**? ([RFC 0052]'s last open question.)
//!
//! The agreement itself is pinned in `wavedb-core`, but every test there applies
//! whole batches to an in-memory store that cannot tear. The claim those tests
//! cannot reach is the one the single-batch rule actually makes: a mutation's
//! segment writes and the index writes that describe them land together **or not
//! at all**, so no recovery can produce a chain whose counts have drifted.
//!
//! That matters more than it sounds. A drifted count does not fail — the pager
//! descends by count, so `_at_page` silently returns the wrong rows, and
//! `_len` silently reports a total the list cannot serve. The failure mode is a
//! wrong answer, not an error, which is exactly the kind that needs a test.
//!
//! ## What "crash" means here
//!
//! The store is dropped **without a checkpoint**, so the most recent batches
//! exist only in the journal and recovery has to replay them. Earlier batches
//! are forced out to `data.bin` first, so the walk after reopen crosses both
//! recovery paths — settled pages and replayed frames — inside one chain.
//!
//! ## Why the check runs through the public surface
//!
//! Two public numbers answer it without reaching into the engine, and they
//! disagree exactly when the invariant breaks:
//!
//! - `listed_by_name_len` is the **index**'s answer (the root's subtree sum);
//! - counting what `listed_by_name` yields is the **segments**' answer (the walk
//!   decodes records out of the segments themselves).
//!
//! Comparing them is the user-visible form of "an index entry and its segment
//! disagree", which is a better assertion than poking at internals would be.
//!
//! [RFC 0052]: https://github.com/wavedb/wavedb/blob/main/rfcs/0052-segment-size-as-the-pagination-unit.md
