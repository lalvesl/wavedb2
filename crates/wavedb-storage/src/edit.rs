//! The addressing delta that rides every settle window ([RFC 0046]).
//!
//! A round of [`crate::checkpoint`] already writes one contiguous window and
//! already knows, by the time it has placed its pages, exactly which buckets
//! changed address. This module turns that into an [`EditChunk`] appended to
//! the same window: **the metadata costs no IOp of its own**.
//!
//! Each chunk names the one written before it ([RFC 0048]), so the log is a
//! chain in `data.bin` and the `Commit` frame is one address — the head. The
//! frame therefore costs the same whether the log holds one chunk or a
//! thousand, which is what lets compaction be spaced by the ratio rule below
//! instead of by how large a frame is affordable.
//!
//! ## Two passes, one shape
//!
//! The chunk's byte length has to be known before the window is carved, but
//! its contents are only known after the runs are handed out. Both passes call
//! [`chunk_of`] with the same `full` flag and the same plans, so they build the
//! *same shape* — same slot count, same `changed` length, same `Option` tags —
//! and therefore encode to the same length. The first pass reserves; the second
//! fills in the addresses.
//!
//! ## Compaction
//!
//! [`crate::meta_log::MetaLog`] decides when a round should emit a **full**
//! chunk instead of a delta: one naming every bucket of every type, built from
//! the directories already resident in RAM. A snapshot writes `prev = 0` — it
//! stands alone, so it ends the chain rather than extending it.
//!
//! [RFC 0046]: ../../../rfcs/0046-directory-deltas-in-the-window.md
//! [RFC 0048]: ../../../rfcs/0048-chained-addressing-log.md
