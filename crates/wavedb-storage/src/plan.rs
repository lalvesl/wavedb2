//! Phase 1 of a checkpoint ([RFC 0041]) — turning a round of touched ids into
//! page **images**, grouped per bucket, writing nothing.
//!
//! The pre-0041 settle walked a round **per `Id`**, and every id did a whole
//! read-modify-write of its bucket page: a hundred ids landing in one bucket
//! cost a hundred read/alloc/write/free cycles of the same page. Here the ids
//! are grouped by bucket first, so a page is read once, receives every id that
//! routes to it, and is serialised once. The images go to
//! [`crate::checkpoint`], which places all of them in one contiguous window.
//!
//! Splits are planned here too, **after** the ids are applied: linear hashing
//! only ever moves keys out of the bucket being split, so a record placed
//! against the pre-split directory keeps its address (or is repartitioned by
//! the split itself). Nothing is written until the whole shape is decided, so
//! no page is ever written twice in one checkpoint.
//!
