//! [`Dictionary`] — the per-`STRUCT_HASH` raw-content zstd dictionary.
//!
//! A page holds records of exactly one type, so each type gets one dictionary
//! with nothing foreign diluting it. zstd accepts **any bytes** as a
//! dictionary (no `ZDICT` trainer): this is simply a capped, **append-only**
//! buffer of record bytes sampled as writes settle.
//!
//! ## Versioning — a version is a prefix
//!
//! A page compressed against dictionary state X must be decompressed against
//! the exact same bytes. Because the buffer only ever appends, a state is
//! fully identified by its **length**: a page stamps the buffer length at
//! compression time (`dict_len`), and decompression binds `buf[..dict_len]`.
//! Every superseded version is a prefix of the same live buffer, so nothing
//! is ever freed or recompressed to stay readable.
//!
//! ## Storage & recovery
//!
//! The dictionary is stored in `data.bin` like a page: a block run handed out
//! by the allocator, holding `[len (u32 LE)][to_wire_checked(buf)]`, repointed
//! by its [`Directory`](crate::directory::Directory) whenever the buffer
//! grows (which stops at the cap). On open, `data.bin` is a journal-replay
//! projection: the settle path re-samples the same records in the same order,
//! so the buffer — and every `dict_len` a rebuilt page stamps — is reproduced
//! deterministically and re-persisted. Reading the stored run back becomes
//! load-bearing only when settling checkpoints (stops truncating `data.bin`
//! on open).
