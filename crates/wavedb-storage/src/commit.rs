//! Journal commit + recovery — the journal's crc framing is the engine's
//! **only** atomicity mechanism (user-directed design, 2026-07-07).
//!
//! ## Commit ( [`PageStore::commit_journal`] )
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. rotate: create journal_<ts+1>.log, swap under the append lock (µs —
//!    writers redirect, no settle work under the lock)
//! 2. dispose of the PREVIOUS checkpoint's generation: the journal just
//!    rotated out carries its `Commit` frame, so this is where that frame is
//!    known durable — delete the journal it retired, roll the protected set
//!    (RFC 0047). No barrier: an ordinary `Batch` append already flushed it
//! 3. drain: settle everything queued into pages — ONE window write
//!    (RFC 0041), carrying that round's descriptor changes with it
//!    (RFC 0046) — then fsync `data.bin`
//! 4. append ONE `Commit { done: old_ts, head }` frame to the NEW journal —
//!    **no fsync**. The frame is a *pointer* into the addressing log the
//!    windows already wrote, naming only its newest chunk since each chunk
//!    names the one before it (RFC 0048), so it is a fixed 16 bytes however
//!    long the log is — and the next `Batch` append's barrier carries it
//!    (RFC 0046)
//! 5. hold this round's own retirement for the next checkpoint's step 2
//! ```
//!
//! A checkpoint therefore costs ONE barrier — the `data.bin` sync in step 3 —
//! and no barrier is paid anywhere else on its behalf.
//!
//! ## Recovery ( [`restore`] )
//!
//! Scan `journal_*.log` sorted by timestamp; the **newest decodable
//! `Commit`** is the base: the chain is walked back from the head it names
//! ([`crate::edit::walk`]) and folded on in write order
//! ([`crate::edit::Replay`]) to rebuild every
//! directory and dictionary run, the allocator derives from those runs plus
//! the log's own, journals it covers (`ts <= journal_ts`) are skipped (and
//! cleaned up), and every `Batch` in the remaining journals replays through
//! the normal commit + settle path (re-settling is idempotent). A torn
//! `Commit` frame is invisible — the retired journal is still on disk and
//! rules. No `Commit` anywhere ⇒ first-generation full rebuild.
