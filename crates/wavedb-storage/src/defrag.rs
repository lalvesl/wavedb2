//! Free-space defragmentation ([RFC 0042]) — relocating isolated live pages so
//! free extents coalesce into windows a whole checkpoint can land in.
//!
//! Copy-on-write page rewrites free the old run and allocate elsewhere, so
//! `data.bin` accumulates holes whose *total* size stays ample while the
//! *largest contiguous* one shrinks. Once no hole fits a checkpoint's window
//! ([RFC 0041]) every checkpoint grows the tail and the file grows
//! monotonically over mostly-free space.
//!
//! The defragmenter fixes the shape, not the size: it picks live page runs
//! whose neighbours are already free — moving one merges the gap on its left,
//! the run itself, and the gap on its right into a single extent — copies them
//! **forward to the tail** (best-fit would cheerfully drop a page back beside
//! the hole it was vacating), and repoints their descriptors. The bytes are
//! moved verbatim: a page is position-independent, so nothing is decoded,
//! recompressed, or re-planned.
//!
//! Safety falls out of what the checkpoint already guarantees. The relocation
//! rides the same window write, the vacated runs are freed through the
//! allocator's protected set — so a run the last durable `Commit` still names
//! is only released after the next one — and the directory is merely marked
//! dirty, leaving the persisted chain pointing at the old, still-intact
//! locations until a checkpoint rewrites it.
