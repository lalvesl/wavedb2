//! `wavedb-storage` — the per-node engine: block manager, per-`STRUCT_HASH`
//! page directory (linear hashing), page format, dictionaries, journal pipeline.
//!
//! Built bottom-up. The [`block`] layer (descriptor + allocator), the
//! [`directory`] addressing math, and the [`block_file`] I/O seam are in place;
//! the page format, dictionaries, and journal pipeline follow. See
//! `crates/wavedb-storage/README.md` for the target design.

// Byte-precise packing/hashing code casts deliberately between integer widths.

// The lint fires on the crate's `async fn`s in their *generic* setting; the
// concrete engine's futures are `Send`, and `thread_safety` below asserts it.

/// The engine's thread-safety, **asserted rather than described**.
///
/// `PageStore` is `Send + Sync` and its futures are `Send` today, and nothing
/// arranges that: it holds `parking_lot` locks and `&'static StructStorage`
/// slots, and it never awaits, so both properties fall out of how the code
/// happens to be written. A single `Rc`/`RefCell` field, or one non-`Send`
/// value held across a future await point, would silently take them away.
///
/// That matters because two designs rest on them —
/// [RFC 0064](../../../rfcs/0064-pivot-owned-concurrency-PLANNED.md) builds
/// multi-thread ownership on top, and
/// [RFC 0063](../../../rfcs/0063-engine-yield-map-and-interruptible-engine-PLANNED.md)'s
/// yield map is only meaningful if they hold. 0063 also records what happens to
/// a load-bearing property nobody asserts: its I1 and I2 became invariants by
/// accident, discovered years later by reading for something else. A comment
/// would have the same fate, so these are compile errors instead.
///
/// Both cost nothing at runtime — a `const` closure is type-checked and never
/// called.
