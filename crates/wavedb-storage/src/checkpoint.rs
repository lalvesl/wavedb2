//! Phases 2–4 and 6 of a checkpoint ([RFC 0041]) — one allocation, one write,
//! then the in-memory swap that publishes the new pages.
//!
//! Every image [`crate::plan`] produced — the rewritten pages and a grown
//! dictionary — is placed inside **one contiguous window**: the allocator's
//! existing best-fit finds the smallest free extent that holds the whole
//! round (a recycled window when one exists, the file's tail otherwise), the
//! window is filled block-aligned, and it reaches the disk as a single
//! positioned write. Only afterwards are the descriptor vectors swapped — so
//! a reader either sees the previous pages (still allocated, still valid:
//! page writes are copy-on-write) or the new ones, never a half-written run.
//!
//! The *addressing* state is not written here at all: a checkpoint puts every
//! type's descriptor vector straight into its `Commit` frame
//! ([RFC 0043]), so `data.bin` holds pages and dictionaries and nothing else.
//!
//! Nothing on disk records that these blocks were written together: the window
//! is an allocation-time concept only, and each page keeps its own descriptor.
//! That is what lets pages be freed one by one later and the extent coalesce
//! back into a large hole.
//!
