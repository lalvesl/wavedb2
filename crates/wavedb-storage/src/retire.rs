//! Deferred retirement — the second half of a checkpoint, disposed of by the
//! checkpoint that follows it ([RFC 0047]).
//!
//! A checkpoint's `Commit` frame is written unsynced ([RFC 0046]): it is a
//! *pointer* into an addressing log `data.bin` already made durable, so it
//! needs no barrier of its own and the next ordinary `Batch` append carries it
//! (`fsync` flushes the file, not one write). A checkpoint therefore costs
//! **one** barrier — the `data.bin` sync.
//!
//! What has to wait for that durability is everything the frame *authorises*:
//!
//! - **deleting the retired journal.** If the frame is torn or never lands,
//!   recovery falls back to the previous `Commit`, and that journal's batches
//!   are the only record of what happened since.
//! - **dropping the older generation's block protection.** The allocator
//!   protects the last *two* checkpoints' runs precisely because either can be
//!   the root a crash reopens from; releasing the older one asserts that it
//!   cannot (`BlockAllocator::release_previous`).
//!
//! Both are held in a [`Retiring`] until the **next checkpoint**. Waiting is
//! free: a retained journal is disk, and disk is not the scarce resource.
//! Chasing the durability is not free — completing from the write path puts a
//! lock and an `unlink` inside a batch, and completing from an idle timer pays
//! a whole barrier for housekeeping.
//!
//! The next checkpoint is also where the proof is cheapest. The frame lives in
//! the journal that checkpoint rotates *out*, and [`Journal::barriers`] counts
//! that file's `fsync`s — so comparing it against the count recorded when the
//! frame was appended says whether an ordinary write already carried it. On any
//! node that reached its checkpoint threshold by writing, it did.
//!
//! [RFC 0046]: ../../../rfcs/0046-directory-deltas-in-the-window.md
//! [RFC 0047]: ../../../rfcs/0047-generational-journal-retirement-PLANNED.md
