//! The per-`STRUCT_HASH` page directory and its **linear hashing** addressing.
//!
//! Each `STRUCT_HASH` owns a `Vec<BlockDescriptor>` — one slot ("bucket") per
//! homogeneous page. Records are routed to a bucket by [`hash_of`] reduced through
//! [`bucket_index`]. Linear hashing grows the directory **one bucket at a time**,
//! so a grow rehashes only a single bucket, never the whole type.
//!
//! This module owns the **addressing math** and the directory container. The
//! page-moving half of a split (`split_next`) needs the block I/O layer and lands
//! with it; [`Directory::next_split_bucket`] exposes which bucket is next in line.
//!
//! ## The id hash
//!
//! `hash_of` is **SeaHash** over the `Id`'s 16 little-endian bytes. The seed is a
//! per-database random `[u64; 4]` (persisted in `data.bin` page 0), which gives the
//! DoS resistance (an attacker can't precompute bucket collisions). SeaHash is
//! portable across architecture and endianness, so the directory — rebuilt by
//! **journal replay** — routes every record to the same bucket even if `data.bin`
//! is opened on a different machine.
