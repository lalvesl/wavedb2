//! The record chain ([RFC 0050]) — [`Chain`], a doubly-linked run of sorted
//! [`Segment`]s with a [`SparseTree`] above it, over a [`Store`].
//!
//! [`segment`](super::segment) is one segment's bytes and in-place edits;
//! [`sparse_write`](super::sparse_write) is the index that finds one. This is the
//! structure: locate the segment a key belongs to, edit it, split it when it
//! fills, and keep the index in step — all as one [`Write`] batch the caller
//! folds into its own, so a segment and the entry naming it can never disagree.
//!
//! Removal and merging live in [`chain_remove`](super::chain_remove), the same
//! way `BpTree` splits insert and delete.
//!
//! ## Endpoints are permanent, and that is the point
//!
//! A `BpTree` moves its root as it grows, and every move rewrites the `Pivot`. A
//! chain does not: a split always hands the **new** id to the interior side and
//! lets the endpoint keep its own — the growth end keeps the newer half, any other
//! segment keeps the lower half. So after a chain's first split its `head` and
//! `tail` never change again, the index root never moves either
//! ([`SparseTree`]), and the `Pivot` is written at creation and then essentially
//! never.
//!
//! The one exception is that first split, when `head == tail` and one of them must
//! become the fresh id. `plan_insert` takes `&mut self` for exactly that, and the
//! caller compares the endpoints afterwards — the same shape as `BpTree::root`.
//!
//! ## The size band
//!
//! A segment holds `N…2N` entries: it **splits 50/50 on reaching 2N** and merges
//! at `N/2` (in `chain_remove`). The hysteresis of 4 between the triggers is what
//! stops a chain thrashing at a boundary. RFC 0052 has the reasoning, and why the
//! declared `page = N` is a minimum rather than an exact count.
//!
//! [RFC 0050]: https://github.com/wavedb/wavedb/blob/main/rfcs/0050-clustered-record-chains.md
