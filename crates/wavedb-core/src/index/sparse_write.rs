//! The sparse index's **write half** ([RFC 0052]) — [`SparseTree`], which keeps
//! one entry per chain segment, and every count above it, in step with the chain.
//!
//! [`sparse`](super::sparse) is the node: how one level descends and how it
//! encodes. This is the tree over those nodes — descend, edit the leaf, and climb
//! back rewriting each ancestor's separator and count. Both edits a chain performs
//! ([`plan_upsert`] and [`plan_remove`]) return a [`Write`] batch and commit
//! nothing: the chain folds them into the *same* atomic batch as the segment
//! writes they describe, which is what makes an index entry and its segment
//! unable to disagree.
//!
//! ## The root id never changes
//!
//! A `BpTree` root moves whenever the root splits, and the `Pivot` holding it must
//! be rewritten. Here a root that overflows keeps its own id: its contents move
//! into a **freshly minted child** and the root becomes the internal node above the
//! two halves. One extra node write on a level growth — a rare event — in exchange
//! for a `Pivot` that is written at creation and then essentially never, which is
//! the same permanence RFC 0050 gives a chain's head and tail. That is why every
//! method here takes `&self`: there is no root to hand back.
//!
//! ## What is deferred
//!
//! An emptied node is dropped from its parent and removed from the store, so
//! removals leak nothing. But this tree **never merges underfull nodes**, and a
//! root left with a single child is not collapsed: nodes drain and stay drained,
//! and a tree that grew a level never gives it back. The dense `BpTree` has the
//! full cycle (`tree_delete`); this half of RFC 0050 phase 3a was not written.
//!
//! It is **accepted debt**, not a design position (RFC 0050, phase 8a): this index
//! holds one entry per *segment*, so a million records at N=16 is ~62 500 entries
//! and two or three levels even drained. Collapsing also has a real cost — it means
//! reading a child that may already have a pending write in the batch being
//! planned. When it is paid, it mirrors `chain_remove`: synchronous, same batch.
//!
//! [RFC 0052]: https://github.com/wavedb/wavedb/blob/main/rfcs/0052-segment-size-as-the-pagination-unit.md
