//! [`Chain`]'s removal half ([RFC 0052]) — take an entry out, and rebalance the
//! segment against a neighbour when it falls to `N/2`.
//!
//! Split from [`chain`](super::chain) the same way `BpTree`'s delete is split
//! from its insert: the shrinking side carries the harder policy.
//!
//! ## Why a merge rule exists at all
//!
//! On a chain keyed by a domain value, removals are the only thing that empties a
//! segment. On the **built-in** chain they are not: it is keyed by the live
//! version's authoring instant, so every save *relocates* its record to the
//! growth end — which means interior segments **drain** even when nothing is ever
//! deleted. Without a merge rule a write-heavy collection would end up a long run
//! of nearly-empty segments, reading many of them to yield few records, which is
//! precisely what RFC 0050 exists to avoid.
//!
//! ## The two outcomes
//!
//! Given a starved segment and the neighbour it rebalances against:
//!
//! - **combined < 2N — merge.** One segment absorbs the other, the absorbed id is
//!   deleted, and the neighbour beyond it is repointed.
//! - **combined ≥ 2N — redistribute.** Merging would breach the band and the next
//!   insert would split it straight back, so the entries are shared out evenly
//!   instead, leaving both halves at ≥ N. No link changes, no endpoint moves.
//!
//! When an endpoint takes part in a merge it is the survivor, so `head` and `tail`
//! keep their ids. The single exception is a chain collapsing to one segment,
//! where head and tail necessarily become the same id again.
//!
//! [RFC 0052]: https://github.com/wavedb/wavedb/blob/main/rfcs/0052-segment-size-as-the-pagination-unit.md
