//! What a **save** has to move, once the record itself is written: every
//! derived structure that was keyed off the old version.
//!
//! Split from [`collection_write`](crate::collection_write) for the file
//! budget, along the seam the save already had — `save_planned` decides *that*
//! a version was superseded, this decides what that costs each structure.
//!
//! The four kinds answer the same question differently, and the differences
//! are the whole design:
//!
//! | structure | moves when | writes |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the recency chain | **always** — its key is the authoring instant | one entry |
//! | a declared list | always, even if its order is unchanged ([RFC 0051]) | the whole record |
//! | a secondary index | only if its own fields changed | one key |
//! | a fuzzy index | only the grams that changed ([RFC 0056]) | one key each |
//!
//! A list is the outlier, and not by accident: it is the only one that
//! *duplicates the record*, so any other field moving makes its copy stale.
//! The other three store keys and anchors, so an unchanged input means there is
//! genuinely nothing to say.
//!
