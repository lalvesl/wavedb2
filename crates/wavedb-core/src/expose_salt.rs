//! The registry's **15-bit salt guard** — split from [`crate::expose`] for the
//! file budget, along the seam the macro side already uses (`expose.rs` /
//! `expose_collision.rs`).
//!
//! [`type_salt`] is the low 15 bits of a `STRUCT_HASH`, and it is the
//! discriminator that keeps kinds of value apart where the full hash is not
//! available: the archive-slot address, and the browser's flat `Id → bytes`
//! keyspace. Two occupants sharing it lose that separation.
//!
//! Since RFC 0050 the occupants are not just the declared record types. A
//! NonUnique type also reserves three chain lanes — the record chain, the
//! removal log, the sparse index — each a `STRUCT_HASH` of its own and so a
//! salt of its own. A registry of `n` such types puts `4n` values in a
//! 32768-slot space, and the property they exist to provide ("a segment id can
//! never equal a record anchor, an archive slot, or a tree node") rests on all
//! of them being distinct. So the guard compares occupant sets, not entries.
//!
