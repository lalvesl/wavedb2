//! **Declared lists** ([RFC 0051]) — `#[wavedb::list(...)]`: one more chain of
//! the same records, sorted by a declared property instead of by modification
//! instant, and holding **whole records inline**.
//!
//! That last part is the whole reason to declare one, and the only duplication
//! WaveDB ever performs ([RFC 0054]): the built-in chain carries pointers, so a
//! collection that declares nothing stores each record exactly once. A list buys
//! a dense bulk read in its order, and pays a full copy for it.
//!
//! The mechanism is RFC 0050's, unchanged: the write half threads each list
//! through the same `plan_insert`/`plan_remove` the built-in chain uses, and the
//! read half is the same segment walk.
//!
//! Two differences from the built-in chain are load-bearing:
//!
//! - **The tie-break is the anchor**, not the live version's authoring instant.
//!   The anchor never changes, so a record relocates inside a sorted chain only
//!   when the declared property itself changed. In the built-in chain the
//!   instant *is* the key and relocating on every save **is** the mechanism —
//!   here the same choice would be pure cost.
//! - **A list reads ascending**, head to tail, because that is what a declared
//!   order means. The built-in chain reads from the tail because its order is
//!   recency.
//!
//! Liveness still lives on the anchor: a list holds exactly the living records,
//! so every planner here is gated on the built-in chain's verdict rather than
//! deciding membership on its own.
//!
//! [RFC 0051]: https://github.com/wavedb/wavedb/blob/main/rfcs/0051-ordered-record-lists.md
