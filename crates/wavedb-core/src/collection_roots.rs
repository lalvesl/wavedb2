//! Which **structures** a collection has, and how they are created.

//! Split from [`collection`](crate::collection) for the file budget.
//!
//! Every collection has three chains of the **same shape** — instant-keyed
//! segments holding ids and nothing else ([RFC 0054]): the **recency** chain
//! (one entry per living record, at its live version's instant) and the
//! **removal log** (one per removed record, at its removal instant), which
//! together answer "what changed" and "what died"; plus one chain per declared
//! `#[wavedb::list]`, which is the only kind that carries records.
//!
//! Everything here answers "open the structure this `Pivot` names"; the creator
//! at the end is where they are made.
