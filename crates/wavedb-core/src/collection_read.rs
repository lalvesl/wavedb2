//! [`Collection`]'s reading half — `get`, `history`, `search`, `search_by` and
//! `all`.
//!
//! Split from [`collection`](crate::collection) for the file budget, along the
//! layer seam the write side already uses (`collection_write` /
//! `collection_remove`).
//!
//! Every read here resolves records **by address**: the index yields anchors and
//! each one is fetched with `get_of`. That is one page read and one dictionary
//! decompression per record, which is exactly the cost RFC 0050's chain exists
//! to collapse — so this module is where phase 6 lands, descending the chain's
//! sparse index and streaming whole segments instead.
//!
//! [`get`](Collection::get) already needs no index at all: a record's anchor is
//! a computed address, and it resolves for removed records too, which is what
//! keeps history navigable.
