//! [`Collection`]'s removal half — `remove`, the one op that writes the `dead`
//! log and the one that takes a record out of the living set.
//!
//! Split from [`collection_write`](crate::collection_write) for the file budget,
//! along the same seam the index layer already uses (`tree_insert` /
//! `tree_delete`, `chain` / `chain_remove`): the shrinking side carries its own
//! policy and its own invariants.
//!
//! **Bytes are never destroyed.** A removal de-indexes the record and logs the
//! event; the record itself stays at its anchor, so `Collection::get` and a
//! history walk keep resolving it by address. What changes on the record is one
//! flag — [`Metadata::removed`] — because liveness is a property of the anchor
//! rather than of a membership tree (RFC 0050).
//!
//! [`Metadata::removed`]: crate::Metadata::removed
