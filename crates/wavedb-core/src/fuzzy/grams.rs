//! Decomposition: normalized codepoints in, posting keys out.
//!
//! A string of `L` codepoints is padded with `n-1` sentinels at each end and
//! cut into every window of `n`, yielding `L + n - 1` grams — the padding is
//! what makes the first and last characters carry as much weight as the
//! middle ones, so a typo in `"ada"`'s first letter still costs the same as
//! one in its second.
//!
//! ## Why the key is fixed-width codepoints, not UTF-8
//!
//! RFC 0056 justified this by prefix safety — that the UTF-8 encoding of `ab`
//! byte-prefixes that of `abc`, so a scan for one would sweep up the other.
//! **That reason does not survive contact with the invariant.** `n` is fixed
//! per index (it folds into the `STRUCT_HASH`), so every gram has the same
//! *codepoint* count, and UTF-8 is self-synchronizing: if one such gram's
//! bytes prefixed another's, decoding would give the same `n` codepoints and
//! they would be the same gram. There is no collision to prevent, and
//! `utf8_is_prefix_safe_too_which_is_not_why` pins that down.
//!
//! Three reasons that do hold, and they are enough:
//!
//! - **The sentinel cannot be encoded in UTF-8 at all.** Padding needs a
//!   symbol no user can type; `u32::MAX` is above the Unicode range, so it is
//!   free here and would need an in-band escape — and escaping rules — in any
//!   character encoding. This one is decisive on its own.
//! - **The length byte has a known home.** [`key_len`] reads the last byte,
//!   which is only sound because everything before it is exactly `4n`. With
//!   variable-width grams the boundary between gram and length moves with the
//!   gram's content.
//! - **The scan prefix is a constant.** `Bound::Prefix` takes `4n` bytes, not
//!   a length re-derived per query.
//!
//! Four bytes per codepoint costs 12 where 3–6 would do, and space is the
//! abundant resource.
