//! Fuzzy string search ([RFC 0056]) — the text layer.
//!
//! An n-gram posting index over the existing `BpTree<SecKey>`: the indexed
//! string is normalized, padded, cut into n-grams, and each distinct gram
//! becomes a key `[gram][len][anchor]`. A query decomposes the same way, so
//! looking up one gram is a `Bound::Prefix` scan.
//!
//! This module is everything that happens **before** the tree and **after**
//! it: normalization ([`fold`]), decomposition ([`grams`]), and the
//! filter/verify arithmetic ([`distance`]). It touches no `Store` and is
//! therefore the half that can be property-tested against brute force — which
//! RFC 0056 names as load-bearing, because a filter that is wrong by one
//! silently loses matches and nothing downstream would notice.
//!
