//! `Metadata` — the per-record header carried by every stored record: the
//! version chain, authorship, and the access rule.
//!
//! The engine's per-version contract is exactly **who wrote it, when, and
//! under which permission**. The chain exists to review how the store
//! looked at a moment — it is not domain data, and it ends at the type's
//! own `STRUCT_HASH` boundary (a schema migration is a new type with a
//! fresh chain), so a domain fact like "member since" belongs in the
//! record's own fields.
//!
//! Chain links are **authoring instants, not addresses**: an archived
//! version's id is *derived* from the instant its bytes were authored
//! (see `crate::record`'s slot derivation), so a `u64` names a version
//! and no link ever needs repointing after the fact.
