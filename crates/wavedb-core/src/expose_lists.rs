//! The declared-list wire reads — the engine behind [`Command::Listed`] and
//! [`Command::ListLen`], split from [`crate::expose`] for the file budget the
//! way [`crate::expose_changes`] is.
//!
//! A `#[wavedb::list]` is the only structure that stores records densely in a
//! declared order ([RFC 0051]), and a rendered page is one segment read
//! ([RFC 0052]) — but until these two commands existed, all of that was
//! reachable only from a `LocalHandle` or a `#[server]` body. The thing that
//! renders the page is exactly the thing that could not ask for it.
//!
//! ## Why these are buffered and `search_by` still is not
//!
//! [`all_values`](crate::expose::all_values) buffers a whole collection
//! because the POST tunnel answers one request with one response; that is a
//! compromise waiting on streaming frames, and a `search_by` range — unbounded
//! by nature — is waiting with it.
//!
//! A list page is not waiting on anything: `limit` is the caller's page size,
//! so the answer is bounded **by construction**. The rule the reply carries is
//! the ordinary pager one — exactly `limit` entries means there may be more, a
//! shorter answer is the end — and it is the client that chose `limit`, so it
//! is never guessing about truncation.
//!
//! The limit is deliberately **not capped**. `All` buffers an entire
//! collection with no bound at all, so capping the narrower command would
//! protect nothing while making one command lie about what it served; a
//! node-wide read budget belongs to the M8 gates, not to one op.
//!
