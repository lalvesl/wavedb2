//! Identity and instant minting: type salts, derived archive addresses,

//!
//! Every time-keyed identity and version instant is minted here. Beyond
//! [`key_nanos`]'s process-unique fused counter, [`mint_instant`] enforces
//! two floors: the caller's **persisted watermark** (a collection's
//! recency/dead maxima — so a rewound wall clock can never author below an
//! instant a catch-up cursor may already have passed) and a process-wide
//! **last-minted watermark** (so two tasks reading one floor concurrently
//! can never mint the same instant).
