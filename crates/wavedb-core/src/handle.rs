//! [`DbHandle`] — the one execution-context seam typed generated code runs
//! over.
//!
//! Its `Store`-backed implementation is [`LocalHandle`](crate::LocalHandle),
//! next door in [`local_handle`](crate::local_handle).
//!
//! The `#[wavedb]` macro emits `T::get(&db)` / `value.save(&db)` /
//! `T::collection(&db, pivot)` methods generic over this trait, so the same
//! call sites resolve against every context: a [`LocalHandle`](crate::LocalHandle)
//! driving a [`Store`](crate::Store) directly (engine tests, in-process embedding), the client `Db`
//! sending command frames, and the node-side `ServerDb` a `#[server]` body
//! runs against.
//!
//! Two deliberate signature choices:
//!
//! - **`type Error: From<Error>`** — the client's error is richer than
//!   core's (node refusals, transport faults), so each context brings its
//!   own; core errors convert in.
//! - **Walk-shaped ops return `impl Stream`** even where an implementation
//!   buffers today (the M4 client collects a `Reply::Values` and wraps it in
//!   an iterator stream) — when streaming frames land, only implementations
//!   change, never the generated call sites.
