//! One WebSocket connection actor — the identity presented once, N topics
//! multiplexed over it, events fanned out to every watcher of their topic.
//!
//! The socket splits: a reader subtask owns the receive half (frame reads are
//! not cancel-safe) and forwards messages over a channel ([`ws_dial`](super::ws_dial));
//! the actor selects over that and its command channel, owning the send half.
//! A topic is wire-subscribed once however many watchers share it, and
//! wire-unsubscribed when its last watcher leaves.
//!
//! **The actor survives a dropped socket (W6).** On loss it re-dials,
//! re-subscribes every live topic, and *catches up* each one — navigating the
//! node past the topic's cursor (the greatest instant delivered) via the
//! stateless sync exchange — before trusting the resumed push, so a transient
//! blip does not end a watch and no mutation committed during the outage is
//! missed. The actor ends only when its last watcher leaves (its command
//! channel closes) or the node refuses its identity (fatal).
