//! The HTTP-poll actor — a watch for clients that cannot hold a WebSocket
//! open: one loop per `(addr, identity)` asking the node "anything new?"
//! on an adjustable timer ([`WatchMode::HttpPoll`](super::WatchMode)) that
//! **backs off when idle** — the interval grows after consecutive empty
//! ticks (capped at [`MAX_IDLE_FACTOR`]× the base) and snaps back to the base
//! on the first non-empty answer or a new subscription, so a quiet watch
//! stops hammering the node every interval (W7).
//!
//! Every tick (and immediately on a new watcher — the first successful
//! sync is the liveness ack) it declares the **whole** current topic list,
//! each topic with its **cursor** — the greatest node instant seen there
//! (`None` on a fresh topic: the node answers its current tail, so the watch
//! begins at "now"). The node holds no session state: it navigates the disk
//! past each cursor and answers the changes plus the advanced cursors, which
//! the actor stores for the next tick (the exchange is [`super::sync_call`]).
//! Events fan out to watchers exactly like the WebSocket path.
//!
//! Outage semantics differ from a pushed watch on purpose: a **transport**
//! fault is tolerated (polling is loosely coupled — the next tick retries,
//! watchers just see silence), while a **node refusal** (an expired token,
//! an anonymous sync) is authoritative and ends the actor, closing every
//! watcher's stream. Events committed while the node was down — or before
//! it restarted — are **not** missed: the cursor survives here, and the
//! next successful tick navigates everything past it (W6).
