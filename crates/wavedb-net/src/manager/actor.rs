//! The manager task's routing loop — single-threaded, never ends.
//!
//! Each POST becomes its own subtask (exchanges run concurrently; the
//! manager never serialises requests behind one another); each watched
//! `(addr, identity)` gets one long-lived actor ([`ws_conn`] or [`poll`])
//! the loop routes watch registrations to.
//!
//! **Lifecycle authority lives here**, not in the actors: the loop counts
//! each actor's watchers (by watch id) and drops the actor's channel when
//! the last one unregisters — the actor drains what is already queued and
//! exits, and a *later* watch necessarily arrives after the removal, so it
//! always gets a fresh actor (no ack can race a dying connection). An
//! actor dead for its own reasons (the socket broke) is detected by its
//! closed channel and replaced on the next watch — reconnection is a fresh
//! dial.
