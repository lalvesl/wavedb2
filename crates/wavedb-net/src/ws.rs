//! The WebSocket envelopes — what rides each binary message (both
//! targets; the server session loop lives in `wavedb-quick-node`).
//!
//! The connection replaces the per-request identity: the token is
//! presented **once**, in [`ClientMsg::Hello`], and every later message
//! executes as that verified caller — the WebSocket is bound to an
//! identity the way an HTTP POST never can be. After the hello:
//!
//! - [`ClientMsg::Call`] runs one [`CommandFrame`] through the same gates
//!   and dispatch as a POST body, answered by [`ServerMsg::Item`]s and one
//!   [`ServerMsg::End`] (the framed-stream shape, one message per frame).
//!   Calls are FIFO per connection — the documented client queue model.
//! - [`ClientMsg::Subscribe`] declares interest in a [`Topic`] — a Unique
//!   anchor or one collection `Pivot`, exactly what a screen shows. Every
//!   accepted mutation under the caller's tenant that matches a
//!   subscription arrives as a [`ServerMsg::Event`] carrying the record's
//!   new state. The tenant never rides a topic: it is the connection's
//!   bound identity, so a client cannot watch another tenant's data.
