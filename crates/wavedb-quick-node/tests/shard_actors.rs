//! RFC 0064, first slice: shards over one disk actor, end to end.
//!
//! One test function, because the engine claim is process-global — the same
//! constraint `node_http.rs` works under.
//!
//! What is being proven, in order:
//!
//! 1. the index layer runs **unmodified** against `ShardStore` — `Collection`
//!    reaches storage through four `Store` methods and does not know it is now
//!    talking to another thread;
//! 2. the write really reaches the engine rather than sitting in a shard's
//!    cache, observed by a *second* shard whose cache is empty;
//! 3. a shard genuinely runs **on its own thread**, built there because its
//!    state is non-`Send` — only the `DiskHandle` crosses;
//! 4. a low-priority `Maintenance` hint travels the second queue and runs;
//! 5. a wire [`Request`] handed to the [`Router`] is executed by a shard
//!    worker and answered — the ingress path with no engine on the caller's
//!    thread at all.

// Shard futures are non-`Send` by construction; the test runtime is
// current-thread, which is the model this crate already declares.
