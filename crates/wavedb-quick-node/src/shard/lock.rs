//! Per-owner serialisation — the brake the shard model needs.
//!
//! ## What it prevents
//!
//! `concurrent_node_clobber.rs` in `wavedb-core` states the invariant this
//! restores, and states it as a property of the **executor**, not of any
//! structure:
//!
//! > `PageStore`'s futures all resolve on first poll (its `get`/`apply` bodies
//! > are synchronous), so on a current-thread runtime a collection op never
//! > yields between its reads and its `apply` and cannot interleave with
//! > another. A `Store` that genuinely suspends — IndexedDB, or anything
//! > network-backed — breaks that, and the loss is **silent**: the record is
//! > live at its anchor and absent from the index.
//!
//! [`ShardStore`](super::ShardStore) is exactly such a store: every cache miss
//! is a message to the disk actor and a real suspension. Putting it under the
//! node without this module would ship that silent loss.
//!
//! The failure is worth spelling out, because it is not an ordering question.
//! Two inserts into one collection both read the same leaf, both compute a
//! successor from it, and the second overwrites the first's node: the first
//! record is written at its anchor and reachable from nothing. `all()` will
//! not list it, a search will not find it, and the caller was told `Ok(id)`.
//! Declaring a `#[wavedb::list]` makes it worse, not better — one more shared
//! structure to lose the update on.
//!
//! ## Why the key is the type, not the Pivot
//!
//! Ownership is per Pivot ([RFC 0064]), so a Pivot-grained lock is what this
//! wants to be. It cannot be yet: `Get`, `Update` and `Remove` carry only an
//! `Id` on the wire, so their Pivot is not known at the point the lock has to
//! be taken. A **mixed** granularity would be worse than a coarse one — an
//! `Insert` holding a Pivot key and an `Update` holding a type key do not
//! exclude each other, which is the bug with extra steps.
//!
//! So the key is `(tenant, STRUCT_HASH)`: coarser than ownership, uniform, and
//! safe. Two collections of one type serialise where they need not; different
//! types and different tenants do not. It narrows to the Pivot the moment
//! those three commands carry one, which RFC 0064 already lists as separable
//! work worth doing on its own.
//!
//! ## Why an async mutex, and why one table for the whole node
//!
//! The per-owner lock is `tokio`'s because it must be held across the
//! operation's awaits — a `RefCell` cannot span one and a blocking mutex would
//! deadlock on it. Uncontended it is a fast path; contended it parks the task
//! and the shard runs something else, which is the point.
//!
//! The **table** is a plain `std` mutex, and the table is shared by every
//! thread that serves — the accept loop, every shard worker. That is not
//! optional. Once routing exists, two operations on one owner can be picked up
//! by two different threads; a per-thread table would give each its own lock
//! and exclude neither, which is the silent loss above with more machinery in
//! front of it. Exclusion has to be a property of the owner, so the table
//! naming owners has to be one. Its critical section is a map lookup with no
//! await inside, so blocking there costs a few nanoseconds and can never
//! deadlock.
//!
