//! Pivot-owned shards ([RFC 0064]) — the concurrency model, first slice.
//!
//! ```text
//!   route by pivot ──> shard i   (owns its cache; runs Collection/BpTree)
//!                        │
//!                        │  DiskRequest  (the only Send surface)
//!                        ▼
//!                   disk actor   (sole owner of the PageStore)
//! ```
//!
//! **What is built here:** the ownership boundary. One disk actor owns the
//! engine, shards reach it only by message, each shard keeps its own cache,
//! and `shard_of(pivot)` decides which shard an operation belongs to. Nothing
//! above `Store` changes.
//!
//! **What is not, and why.** RFC 0064's target splits the disk owner into a
//! journal actor and a page actor, and moves `StructStorage`'s per-type cache
//! into the shards. Both wait on the same open question — the settle path
//! straddles the boundary, reading shard-side caches to write page-side
//! dictionaries — so this slice draws the boundary where it can be drawn
//! correctly and leaves that seam alone.
//!
//! The shard count `N` is [`wavedb_platform::cpu::available`] by default: the
//! parallelism this process may actually use, which is the affinity mask and
//! the container quota rather than the machine's core count.
//!
