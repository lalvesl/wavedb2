//! Which queue the page actor serves next ([RFC 0064]).
//!
//! Two classes reach the actor from outside. **Reads are high priority** —
//! a shard missed its cache and something is waiting on the far end.
//! **Maintenance is low** — settling and checkpointing; nobody is blocked on
//! it. (Work the actor starts on its own behalf, such as reading a page in
//! order to merge into it, never re-enters a queue at all: that would be a
//! request waiting on a request in the same bounded queue, which is a
//! self-deadlock rather than an inefficiency.)
//!
//! ## Why strict priority is wrong
//!
//! Draining reads first, always, starves maintenance — and maintenance is not
//! optional background work. Starve it and the journal is never checkpointed,
//! so it grows without bound, and recovery time grows with it. Starvation here
//! is an out-of-memory, not an unfairness.
//!
//! ## The valve is driven by bytes, not by counts
//!
//! What hurts is not "maintenance is late", it is "unsettled state is
//! growing" — so the thing that opens the valve is the **volume** behind it,
//! not a message count and not a clock.
//!
//! That distinction has already cost this project once: the benchmark
//! adapter's `MAINTAIN_EVERY = 5000` operations never fired while 649 MB of
//! journal accumulated, because a count of operations says nothing about how
//! much log they produced. It became a byte threshold. The same mistake is
//! available here.
//!
//! ## It stabilises itself
//!
//! Below the low mark maintenance may be starved indefinitely, and that is
//! safe **because starving it is what ends it**: unserved maintenance is
//! exactly what makes the volume grow, so the pressure rises into the ratio
//! band and then, if reads still dominate, past the high mark where
//! maintenance becomes mandatory. No timer is needed to escape the corner.
//!
//! [RFC 0064]: ../../../../rfcs/0064-pivot-owned-concurrency-PLANNED.md
