//! `ShardStore` — a shard's view of storage ([RFC 0064]).
//!
//! This is the whole seam. The index layer above (`Collection`, `BpTree`, the
//! chains, the declared lists, everything `#[wavedb]` expands to) reaches its
//! backend through four `Store` methods and takes the store **per call**, so
//! replacing `impl Store for PageStore` with this changes nothing above it.
//!
//! What a shard owns is its **cache**; what it does not own, it asks the disk
//! actor for. That division is the design: a working set that fits stays on
//! one thread and never synchronises with anything, and only a miss costs a
//! message.
//!
//! Deliberately non-`Send` (`RefCell`, `Rc`): a shard's state must not be able
//! to move between threads, and the type system saying so is stronger than a
//! scheduler promising it. Only [`super::msg::DiskRequest`] crosses.
//!
//! [RFC 0064]: ../../../../rfcs/0064-pivot-owned-concurrency-PLANNED.md

// the type non-`Sync` and the shard is only ever reached through `Rc`, so
// `spawn_detached`'s factory (which is `Send`) cannot capture one.
