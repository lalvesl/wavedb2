//! Ingress routing — where a request stops being the accept thread's problem.
//!
//! The accept loop reads a socket, decodes a [`Request`], and hands it to the
//! shard that owns it. It executes nothing itself: no gate, no engine call, no
//! `Store` of its own. That is the point of the split — accepting is I/O, and
//! serving is work, and they should not share a thread.
//!
//! ## The routing key is the brake's key, and it has to be
//!
//! [`OwnerLocks`](super::OwnerLocks) excludes two operations on one owner from
//! interleaving, and today its key is `(tenant, STRUCT_HASH)` because `Get`,
//! `Update` and `Remove` do not carry a Pivot on the wire (`CONCURRENCY_BRAKE.md`
//! spells out why a *mixed* granularity would be worse than a coarse one).
//! Routing uses the **same** key, via
//! [`Owner::Unique`](super::Owner::Unique) — including for collection
//! commands, whose Pivot-grained [`Owner::Collection`] arm is right for the
//! target and wrong for today. Route one way and brake the other and two
//! operations on one owner can be picked up by two shards holding two
//! different locks, which is the silent index loss with routing in front of
//! it. Both narrow to the Pivot together or neither does.
//!
//! ## The cost that is here on purpose
//!
//! Routing needs the tenant, the tenant comes from the token, so the token is
//! verified here **and again** by gate 1 on the shard. One extra HMAC per
//! request. Threading the resolved [`Caller`](wavedb_core::expose::Caller)
//! through the [`Job`] would remove it, at the price of a `handle` that trusts
//! its caller to have run gate 1 — a seam worth having only once it is
//! measured, and it is not.
