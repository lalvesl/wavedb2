//! The disk actor — sole owner of the storage engine ([RFC 0064]).
//!
//! Every shard reaches storage by message; nothing else holds the
//! [`PageStore`]. That single ownership is what the design is for, and it buys
//! three things at once:
//!
//! - the engine's locks stop having a second party to contend with;
//! - two shards wanting the same page produce one read rather than two (the
//!   de-duplication a shared cache cannot do without a single owner);
//! - the process-wide `EngineClaim` has exactly one holder by construction
//!   instead of by convention.
//!
//! ## Two queues
//!
//! Requests ([`DiskRequest`]) are high priority — a shard is awaiting each
//! one. Maintenance ([`Maintenance`]) is low — nobody is. Which to serve is
//! [`Priority`]'s decision, driven by the journal's length, and the reasoning
//! (including why strict priority would be an out-of-memory rather than an
//! unfairness) is in [`super::priority`].
//!
//! **The valve bounds waiting, not latency.** Because the actor serves one
//! message at a time, a read arriving while a long checkpoint runs waits for
//! that whole checkpoint — priority between *queued* items says nothing about
//! the item *executing*. Bounding read latency needs the maintenance work
//! itself to become interruptible, which is [RFC 0063]'s re-entrant `drain`.
//! That makes 0063 a prerequisite of this scheme rather than a parallel item.
//!
//! ## Not split in two yet
//!
//! RFC 0064's target splits this into a **journal actor** and a **page
//! actor**. That waits on the settle path's ownership question — `plan_slot`
//! reads shard-side caches to write page-actor-side dictionaries — which is
//! open. One actor owning the whole engine is the ownership boundary drawn
//! where it can be drawn correctly today.
//!
//! [RFC 0064]: ../../../../rfcs/0064-pivot-owned-concurrency-PLANNED.md
//! [RFC 0063]: ../../../../rfcs/0063-engine-yield-map-and-interruptible-engine-PLANNED.md
