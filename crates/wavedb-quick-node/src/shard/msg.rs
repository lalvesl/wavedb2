//! What crosses a thread boundary ([RFC 0064]).
//!
//! This module is the whole `Send` surface of the shard model, and that is the
//! point: everything here is **plain data** — ids, wire bytes, a `Vec<Write>`
//! — so nothing about the engine or the index layer has to become `Send` to
//! run shards on separate threads. A shard's own state (its cache, its
//! `Collection` handles, its in-flight futures) never leaves its thread and
//! stays free to be `Rc`/`RefCell`.
//!
//! The reply channel is the other half of that: a request carries the sender
//! it wants answered on, so the disk actor never blocks and the caller simply
//! awaits. Request/reply is `await`, not a synchronous message — which is why
//! the actor-to-actor deadlock surface [RFC 0058] could not resolve does not
//! arise here.
//!
