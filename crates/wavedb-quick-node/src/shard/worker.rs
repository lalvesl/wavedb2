//! One shard's worker thread — where an operation actually executes.
//!
//! A worker owns a thread, a current-thread runtime, a [`LocalSet`], and its
//! own [`ShardStore`] (and therefore its own cache). It receives [`Job`]s and
//! answers them; nothing else about it crosses a thread boundary, which is why
//! everything it holds may be `Rc`.
//!
//! ## Why each job is its own local task
//!
//! Serving jobs one after another in the receive loop would make a shard's
//! concurrency exactly one, and the operations that must not interleave are
//! already excluded by [`OwnerLocks`] — so the serialisation would buy nothing
//! and cost everything: one operation waiting on the disk actor would idle the
//! whole shard. Spawning each job locally lets a shard have as many operations
//! in flight as it has distinct owners, which is the model this is for.
//!
//! ## What crosses, and what does not
//!
//! Into the worker: a [`Request`] and a `oneshot` for its [`Answer`] — plain
//! data. Out of it: a [`Mutation`] per committed write, handed to the accept
//! thread's publisher through the [`Publish`](crate::subscribe::Publish) seam,
//! because the WebSocket subscription table lives there and must not be
//! touched from here. Shared with everything: the [`OwnerLocks`] table, which
//! is the *only* structure that has to be one for the node rather than one per
//! thread — see [`super::lock`].
//!
//! [`LocalSet`]: tokio::task::LocalSet
