//! The WebSocket session loop (native, server side): one identity-bound
//! connection carrying commands **and** live subscription events.
//!
//! The socket arrives here already upgraded (`serve` wrote the `101`). The
//! first message must be [`ClientMsg::Hello`] — gate 1 runs once, binding
//! the connection to a [`Caller`]; every later message executes as it, no
//! per-message token. Then the loop multiplexes two sources:
//!
//! - the **client** — [`Call`](ClientMsg::Call)s (gates 2–3, answered by
//!   `Item*`/`End`, FIFO per connection) and
//!   [`Subscribe`](ClientMsg::Subscribe)/[`Unsubscribe`](ClientMsg::Unsubscribe),
//!   each acked with a [`TopicOk`](ServerMsg::TopicOk) once applied (FIFO ⇒
//!   an acked watch cannot miss a later mutation); an **anonymous**
//!   `Subscribe` is refused by closing the connection;
//! - the **event channel** — mutations the [`NotifyStore`] pushed for this
//!   connection's subscriptions, forwarded verbatim.
//!
//! Frame reads are not cancel-safe, so a dedicated reader task owns the
//! read half and forwards decoded messages over a channel; the loop selects
//! on that channel (cancel-safe) and the event channel. On disconnect every
//! subscription the connection held is dropped.
//!
