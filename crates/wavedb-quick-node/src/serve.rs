//! The accept loop and per-connection handling (native, HTTP POST).
//!
//! One connection = one request/response exchange (the tunnel sends
//! `connection: close`). Connections are handled concurrently on the current
//! thread via a [`LocalSet`] + [`spawn_local`], so no `Send` bound leaks onto
//! the `Store`-generic engine futures (deliberately non-`Send` — an internal
//! node seam, not a public API).
//!
//! ## What this thread does, and what it hands off
//!
//! A POST is **routed**: decoded here, executed on the shard that owns it
//! ([`Router`](crate::shard::Router)), written back here. This thread runs no
//! gate and touches no engine on that path.
//!
//! A WebSocket session is not routed yet, and it still executes its `Call`s
//! here — over a **cacheless** store, which is what makes two executors over
//! one engine sound, and under the same [`OwnerLocks`](crate::shard::OwnerLocks)
//! table, which is what keeps the brake a brake across both. Routing it too
//! turns on a question this seam does not get to answer alone: a session binds
//! its identity once at `Hello`, and routing re-verifies the token per
//! command, so a long-lived watch would start refusing the moment its token
//! expired. That is arguably more correct and definitely a behaviour change.
//!
//! [`spawn_local`]: tokio::task::spawn_local
