//! `wavedb-quick-node` — the serving + storage node.
//!
//! **Server and database are the same binary.** A node links a schema
//! crate's `expose_server!` output (`REGISTRY`) — which carries both halves
//! it needs: the dispatch surface ([`Exposure`]) and the storage surface
//! ([`StorageRegistry`], the [`StructStorage`] slots to open the engine with)
//! — binds an HTTP POST socket, and serves records straight out of
//! [`PageStore`].
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn run<E>(registry: E) -> wavedb_quick_node::Result<()>
//! # where E: wavedb_core::expose::Exposure
//! #     + wavedb_storage::StorageRegistry + Copy + Send + 'static {
//! wavedb_quick_node::Server::new(registry)
//!     .data_dir("./data")
//!     .serve("0.0.0.0:7700")
//!     .await
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! **Single node for now.** Durability is the journal (a write is durable
//! once journaled). The ring / gossip / replication / failover machinery the
//! README describes is the target design, deferred.
//!
//! [`Exposure`]: wavedb_core::expose::Exposure
//! [`StorageRegistry`]: wavedb_storage::StorageRegistry
//! [`StructStorage`]: wavedb_storage::StructStorage

// The node serves connections on a single-thread `LocalSet` (see `serve`), so
// the `Store`-generic engine futures are deliberately non-`Send` — an
// internal node seam, not a public `Send`-bounded API. Same stance
// `wavedb-core` and `wavedb-storage` take with their engine seams.
