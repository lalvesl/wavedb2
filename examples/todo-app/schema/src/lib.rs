//! The todo-app schema crate — compiled into the node AND every client.
//!
//! The M4 target surface: the app's whole wire API is its nine `#[server]`
//! functions; **every struct is storage-only** (`store` entries — engine
//! slots, no wire address). The patterns this pins down:
//!
//! - a global username registry at the **system tenant** (0): a Unique
//!   anchor holding the `PivotId` of a NonUnique `UserEntry` collection with
//!   a secondary index on `username`, lazily bootstrapped;
//! - server-side **cross-tenant writes** via `db.as_tenant(..)` (`register`
//!   bootstraps `Auth` + `Profile` + the todo collection in the new tenant's
//!   space) — a seam no client command can reach;
//! - the **profile→pivot path**: every todo function re-derives the
//!   collection from `Profile::get(db)`; a `PivotId` never crosses the wire.
//!
//! Auth here is a placeholder (sha256 + timestamp token) — real tokens and
//! the permission gates are M8.
//!
//! **Sides.** One source, two builds: the macros gate `#[server]` bodies +
//! `expose_server!` under the `server-side` feature and the client stubs +
//! `expose_client!` under `client-side` (both on by default for the tests
//! here; the server/client binaries each pull only their side). Helpers
//! that exist *outside* `#[server]` bodies but serve them — everything
//! under "Private helpers" below — carry `#[cfg(feature = "server-side")]`
//! by hand: that is the schema author's half of the no-leak contract.

// The DbHandle-generic helpers hold `&D` across awaits: their futures are
// only `Send` when the context is — the workspace stance on every
// Store-generic seam.
