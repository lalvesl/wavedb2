//! The **showcase** schema — one small project-tracker domain exercising
//! every WaveDB surface in a runnable pair of processes:
//!
//! - a `Unique` holder ([`Workspace`]) owning a collection handle;
//! - a `NonUnique` collection ([`Project`]) whose records **each own
//!   another collection** ([`Task`] — pivots nest freely in records);
//! - secondary indexes (`by_name`, `by_status`) driving `#[server]`
//!   filtered reads (there is no query DSL — a filtered read IS a server
//!   function);
//! - server-side bootstrap (`create_pivot` has no wire command, so
//!   collections are born inside `#[server]` bodies);
//! - the `server-side`/`client-side` features (both on by default here;
//!   a deployed client pulls `client-side` only and the bodies below are
//!   never compiled into it).
//!
//! Run it: `cargo run -p showcase --example node`, then in another
//! terminal `cargo run -p showcase --example client` (see the README for
//! the offline and polling variants).

// The typed handle futures hold `&Db` across awaits — non-Send by design
// (current-thread model), the workspace stance.
