//! M1 smoke: what the `#[wavedb]` derive alone guarantees, proven end-to-end
//! without any node, transport, or `Db` — `STRUCT_HASH` identity, `WaveWire`
//! round-trips, shape consts, the generated NonUnique collection types, and
//! the **exposure declarations** (`expose_server!` / `expose_client!`): the
//! lists ARE the registry, and only listed items are dispatchable.
//!
//! # The exposure collision guard
//!
//! Both halves of the guard resolve while the schema compiles — these doctests
//! are the proof, since neither outcome is observable from a test body.
//!
//! Two entries that hash to the same 64-bit `STRUCT_HASH` are **one identity**
//! on the wire; the guard refuses the build:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use wavedb_macros::{expose_server, wavedb};
//!
//! // Same name, same shape, same fields ⇒ same STRUCT_HASH, whatever the path.
//! mod first {

//!
//! Sharing only the low 15 bits (`type_salt`) still reads correctly, so it is a

//!
//! ```compile_fail
