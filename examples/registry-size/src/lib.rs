//! The registry-size measuring stick — the M1 risk item ("does the exposure
//! `match` grow the wasm binary per struct?"), measured in M5.
//!
//! Sixty-four `#[wavedb]` structs are always **defined**; how many the
//! `expose_client!` list **names** is feature-selected (1 / `n16` / `n64`).
//! `scripts/registry_size.sh` builds the three widths for
//! wasm32-unknown-unknown and reports the marginal bytes per exposed struct
//! — the delta isolates exactly what one more exposure line costs (the
//! `match` arms plus the retained `WaveWire` decode), because unexposed
//! definitions are dead code the linker drops.
//!
//! The structs cycle four field shapes so structurally identical decode fns
//! don't collapse into one by LLVM function merging (real schemas are
//! heterogeneous). All are Unique — a NonUnique adds its generated
//! Pivot/BpTree machinery on top, which is schema code, not registry cost.
