//! WaveDB comparative benchmark — RFC 0060.

//! Two binaries share this library: `wavedb-bench` measures, and `bench-gen`
//! fills. The split exists because the fill has to run **inside a Nix builder**
//! to become a cached seed derivation (§6), where nothing is timed and nothing
//! is recorded.

// Bench-scale arithmetic: row counts, byte totals and nanosecond sums are all
// far inside the ranges these lints guard, and the alternative — `try_from`
// plumbing on every count — would bury the measurement logic.
