//! Process lifecycle for the server bracket (RFC 0060 §2).
//!
//! The three server adapters differ in almost everything — connection string,
//! durability knob, compaction command — but share four mechanics, and those
//! are here so each adapter reads as its own database rather than as plumbing.
//!
//! One of them is load-bearing for the measurement: **write bytes come from the
//! server's `/proc/<pid>/io`, not ours**. In the embedded bracket the engine
//! writes in the benchmark's own process, so `/proc/self/io` is exactly right;
//! in the server bracket our process writes nothing but socket traffic, and
//! reading `self` would report a flat zero for every phase.
