//! The WaveDB adapter — engine in-process, the embedded bracket.
//!
//! Three constraints from RFC 0060 §5 shape this file:
//!
//! - **One store per process.** Every open is scoped so the `EngineClaim`
//!   drops before the next one; the cold-read phase depends on it.
//! - **The typed path only.** Reads go through `CollectionHandle::get`, which
//!   routes by `STRUCT_HASH`. `Store::get` is an untyped fallback that probes
//!   every slot — a path no generated code takes.
//! - **Steady state.** The settle queue is drained and the journal checkpointed
//!   before the "settled" footprint, so the number is not just work postponed.
