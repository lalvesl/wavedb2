//! Which engine seam a WaveDB row measures — the single/multi-thread axis.
//!
//! Both rows run the *same* workload through the *same* index layer. The only
//! difference is what sits under `Store`:
//!
//! - [`Engine::Direct`] — the `PageStore` in this thread. One thread does
//!   everything, and a `get` that hits the cache is a function call.
//! - [`Engine::Sharded`] — the RFC 0064 shape: the engine is owned by a **disk
//!   actor** on its own thread, and this thread reaches it through a
//!   `ShardStore` (its own cache) by message. Two threads, and every cache miss
//!   is a channel round trip and a thread wake-up.
//!
//! ## What the pair can and cannot show
//!
//! It measures **the cost of the boundary**, not the benefit of parallelism.
//! Three separate reasons, and each alone is enough:
//!
//! 1. the benchmark issues one operation at a time (`block_on` per op, each
//!    timed alone), so a second shard would never have a second operation;
//! 2. the brake serialises per owner and its key is `(tenant, STRUCT_HASH)`
//!    today, so this workload — one type, one tenant — is **one owner**
//!    however many shards exist, even under a concurrent client;
//! 3. there is only one shard here anyway: the per-shard worker threads belong
//!    to the node's `Router`, and a benchmark driving `Store` directly builds
//!    none. This thread is the shard.
//!
//! So the axis is honestly named "what does the actor cost". The concurrency it
//! exists to enable needs a concurrent client *and* the Pivot-grained brake
//! before it can be measured at all.
//!
//! No `dyn`: the seam is a trait bound and each row monomorphises to its own
//! concrete engine, the same rule the workspace holds itself to.
