//! The e-commerce workload's adapters (RFC 0060 §3.1).
//!
//! Same five systems, same reporting shape, a different question. The micro
//! workload asks "how fast is one operation on one type"; this one asks "how
//! long does a customer wait", and its phases are therefore **composed**: a
//! checkout is one order *and* its line items, an order page is a user *and* a
//! page of their orders.
//!
//! That composition is where the two workloads disagree about what a database
//! is for, and the disagreement is the measurement:
//!
//! - The SQL trio and MongoDB wrap a checkout in **one transaction**, which is
//!   how an application would write it and costs **one** commit barrier.
//! - WaveDB has no multi-record transaction: every collection op is its own
//!   atomic `Store::apply` batch, so a checkout with five line items is
//!   **seven** batches and seven barriers. That is not a tuning gap, it is the
//!   data model, and pricing it is the reason this workload exists.
