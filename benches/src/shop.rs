//! The e-commerce workload: schema, and the deterministic generator for it.
//!
//! The micro benchmark (`schema.rs`) measures one operation on one flat type.
//! This one measures what an application actually asks a database for: a
//! **checkout** (one order plus its line items, which is inherently several
//! records) and an **order-history page** (a user, a page of their orders, and
//! one order's items). Those are the units a user waits on, so this workload is
//! reported as *latency of a composed operation* rather than rows per second.
//!
//! Three modelling decisions are load-bearing, and each of them is a claim:
//!
//! - **A user is a tenant.** In WaveDB the tenant is 48 bits *of the `Id`*, so
//!   "one shop, many customers" is what tenancy is for, and this is the first
//!   workload here that has more than one of them (RFC 0060 open question 9).
//!   The other four have no such concept, so they carry a `user_id` column and
//!   an index on it — which is precisely the cost being compared.
//! - **Records hold pivots.** `User` holds its `Shopping` collection's
//!   `PivotId`, and each `Shopping` holds its `Product` collection's. That is
//!   how trees nest, and it is the structural counterpart of the two foreign
//!   keys the SQL schema needs.
//! - **The lists are the read path.** `Shopping` declares a list ordered by
//!   `bought_at` and `Product` one ordered by `name`, both `page = 10`, so
//!   rendering a page of ten is one segment read rather than a walk. That is
//!   the whole point of RFC 0051, and this workload is where it gets priced —
//!   against `ORDER BY … LIMIT 10 OFFSET n` on the other four.
