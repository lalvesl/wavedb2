# Run the comparative benchmark on a machine quiet enough to be believed.
#
# The suite refuses to *record* a row when the 1-minute load average at start
# exceeds its budget (`NOISE_PER_CPU`, floor 2.00) — a slow number a future
# bisect blames on a commit is worse than no number. That guard is right, and
# it is also easy to trip by accident: `nix run` builds first, and a 40-second
# cargo build pushes the 1-minute average past 2.00 just in time to be sampled.
# Two runs were burnt that way, ~45 minutes each, before this script existed.
#
# So: build first, wait for the machine to go quiet, and only then measure.
#
# Usage: scripts/bench.sh [args passed to the benchmark]
#   scripts/bench.sh --only wavedb --workload micro
#   scripts/bench.sh --quick            # smoke; records nothing
#
# Env:
#   BENCH_LOAD_MAX   launch below this 1-minute load average (default 1.0)
#   BENCH_WAIT_SECS  give up waiting after this long (default 900)
